## priceapi

Simple example code for pulling price data from Binance and Bitfinex.

this api source is a bit messy and probably lots of dead commented code
but w/e just an example.


### Usage


Open a terminal/shell/command line
```
git clone https://github.com/treypeng/priceapi.git
cd priceapi
npm install
node main.js
```

that's it. You should see some daily candles from binance and bitfinex.
